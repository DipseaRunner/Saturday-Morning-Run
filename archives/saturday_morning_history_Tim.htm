      Morning Runs: Part IV</span><!--mstheme--></font></H2>
      <P class=GazByline>by Tim Amyx</P>
      <P class=GazBody><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Originally

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">This
      is one of those articles that could very well be written by a more
      knowledgeable person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone
      with closer ties to the runs, or someone who has done it more often than
      I. Since that person has not stepped forward in the past 6 years, I’ll
      take a crack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This headline
      is titled, Part IV because this is the 4<sup>th</sup> version of a history
      of the Saturday morning runs at the Mountain Home Inn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The other three articles covered the years from 1971 up through the
      mid 1990’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’ll take the
      years from 1993 until about 2000. That will leave at least another 4 years
      for the next person to write on at a later date.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Re-capping
      the obvious of what was written before… a little background and history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Don Picket and Bryan Lowry were the first organizers of the
      Mountain Home Inn runs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
      was in 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These runs for
      years were never publicized, never organized, never had a leader, plan, or
      specific route.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was (and
      still is) simply a meeting place for pretty decent runners who want to run
      on the trails on the south side of Mount Tam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Although there were never any assigned leaders or organizers, there
      has always been a runner or two who has taken the lead.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it’s the most creative, sometimes it’s the
      veteran of the group, sometimes it’s the last person who shows up at
      9:05 and they say, “Hey, Tomas, where are we going today?”&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Almost
      34 years have passed since the Mountain Home Inn runs began. Hans Roenau
      is certainly the last of the originals, yet there are countless others who
      have been around since the 1980’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It would take the entire Gazette to mention the regulars who have
      come and gone since 1971. Some have done it for chunks of time and moved
      on, while others disappear for years and then later return.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Anyway,
      I’ll be focusing for the most part of the years from 1993, when I began
      running with the Mountain Home Inn group on Saturdays, up until the early
      2000’s, when family and the ultra racing life of my wife have taken us
      away from the Mountain Home Inn.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Florencia
      and I moved to Mill Valley in 1992 and began doing Tamalpa and Mountain
      Home Inn runs in the spring of 1993.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Just like the runners of the early 1970’s, we’d meet at the MHI
      to run the trails and get primed and in shape for the Dipsea Race.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Starting out of the MHI there are 5 different ways to go….
      Up the Railroad Grade, UP toward the Matt Davis Trail, Down East toward
      the Pipeline trail, Down West toward Alice Eastwood and Troop 80, and Down
      South toward Muir Woods and The Dipsea trail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>There are typical routes that often amount to about 60-90 minutes
      of running, or if you’re up for the longer group, there are 90-120
      minute runs as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Of
      the many people who came and went during the 8 years I was running, I can
      mention probably twenty names of the people I saw there the most: Mary
      Allaire, Janet Bowman, Jamie Wendel Berns, Tom Berns, Jack Burns, Gayle
      Murphy Burns, Burns and Schreiber, Tomas Pastalka, Jim Garlock, Terry
      Parks, Eric Parks, Quinn Folkes, Roger Gordon, Lorelei Vose, Maeve Garvey
      Burke, Hans Roenau, Bill Katz and Ron Rahmer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Ron Rahmer was particularly influential to myself and the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>First of all, he was a friend of my fathers and they ran
      together as far back as the late 1970’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When my father introduced me to the Mountain Home Inn runners and
      Ron Rahmer in 1989, he introduced me to Ron as, “Wrong Way Rahmer”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You only have to run one Saturday with Ron to understand how
      he got his name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ron passed
      away in 2004 and if there is ever a Mountain Home Inn Hall of Fame
      erected, he’ll be one of its charter members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Running with Ron during the mid and late 1990’s out of the MHI
      was both a blessing and a curse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
      blessing because he was always leading groups on runs through “new”
      trails, “old overgrown” trails, shortcuts through back yards, Crossing
      creeks in mid stream, and of course, getting lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Lost not so much in the fact that he didn’t know how to get back,
      but lost in the sense that his 6 mile run, turned into a 10 mile detour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The curse of running with Ron was that you’d never have a clue as
      to how far you’d go or how long you’d be out there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For those who were on a time crunch, it was not a good idea to
      follow Ron.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Never the less,
      Ron was one of the “leaders” throughout my period of running out of
      the MHI.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Ron’s
      nemesis and friend was Tomas Pastalka.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Thomas has been with Tamalpa since the 1980’s and he too is still
      running out of the MHI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
      the passing of Ron, and with Han’s easing out of running, Tomas is
      probably the runner with the most seniority who still shows up on a
      consistent basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As
      has been mentioned in other articles or write ups, the runs are scheduled
      52 weeks of the year, rain or shine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Not surprisingly the winter runs when it’s raining are the most
      memorable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The numbers are
      often down from the usual 20-30, down to about a dozen hard core runners.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>These are the most memorable because of the natural beauty
      we’ll see in the creeks and forests with all the running water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On occasion we would drive our cars up to Rock Springs and do runs
      down the Cataract trail to view the pounding water. Beautiful!&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">True
      to what George Frazier said in his article of 1996, the running pace had
      certainly eased off from what it was in earlier years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Normally the leaders would go at an easy pace to begin, and then a
      moderate pace after a mile or two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rarely
      would we run so hard that it felt like a race or that there was any sort
      of competition going on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most
      of the group would go together for the first 3 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was at this point that the group who wanted to go “longer”
      would start a longer loop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
      long runs would range from 7-14 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Those who wanted to just run “about an hour” would head in
      their own direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If a
      group of 25 runners started together at 9:05a.m. it would inevitably
      divide 2 – 4 times before all 25 runners came back.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Although
      the group is not as hard core as it was in the 1980’s, it’s still a
      group of runners who do run well and can easily maintain a 8 to 9 minute
      per mile pace on hills, for at least an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Certainly there are runners who show up who can’t maintain that
      pace, but they never stay with the core of the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They’ll peel off by the time the group makes its first pit
      stop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Around
      the time I started running with the group in 1993, the club began to
      advertise the MHI runs in the Gazette.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For the first 20 years of its existence, there was no publicity at
      all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, it
      was voted down a number of years by the Tamalpa board in the early 1980s,
      when then club president suggested the club list the run in the Gazette.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was strictly a word of mouth thing.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">It’s
      still primarily a word of mouth event, but there is on occasion a person
      who will pop up, after reading the blurb in the Gazette, or perhaps on the
      Tamalpa web page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There has
      been a time or two when someone from out of town visiting will come out
      after having read about the runs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s
      kind of fun to share our knowledge and show off “our” mountain and the
      trails in those instances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Many
      of the earlier mentioned names are no longer part of the MHI regulars,
      myself and my wife included.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone
      has his or her own reasons for moving on. Jobs, family, injuries, and the
      like.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Florencia, of all
      things, outgrew the MHI because she needed to run longer for her ultra
      race training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As it turned
      out most of her Ultra friends would meet on Saturday mornings and begin
      their 2-3 hour runs at Petes in Mill Valley at 7:00 a.m.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Part of this was to run with Ultra friends, and part of this was to
      have an earlier start in the day.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 15.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">One
      day in 1996 Jim Sugar showed up at a MHI run after having been absent for
      a long time.&nbsp; I gave him a hard time and asked him where he had been.&nbsp;
      I, who had at time a 2-year-old daughter, listened to his excuse. “Tim,
      you just wait until your kids reach the age where they play Youth Soccer.&nbsp;
      Your Saturdays will never be the same again.”&nbsp; Two years ago I
      learned first hand what he was talking about.&nbsp; I now have two
      daughters who play Mill Valley Club soccer.&nbsp; My Saturdays have
      definitely changed.&nbsp; Florencia’s lucky to run out on a 7a.m run for
      her ultra training and meet me at the Kids soccer field to watch the
      games.&nbsp; I then try and get a run in sometime late Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Never
      the less, three, maybe four times a year I’ll still make it up to the
      MHI for a Saturday run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Inevitably
      there will be 10-15 faces I know who have been there a long time, and the
      other 5-10 are new faces who have become regulars themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They probably look at me like an “old, has-been”.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Indeed
      there is a new generation of Runners at the Mountain Home Inn. (As well as
      the Garlocks, Pastalkas, and a few other veterans who still come out…)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Many are 30 something guys and gals who are pretty impressive
      runners. There are even a few 20-something kids who must have nothing
      better to do with their lives than run! When I was in my 20’s the last
      thing I’d spend time doing on a weekend was run!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m 45 now, and when I’m not driving my daughters to
      soccer games, there is no place I’d rather be on a Saturday morning than
      the Mountain Home Inn, prepping for a run on Mt. Tam.<o:p>
