	  <p class="GazBody" align="left">In the early to mid 80s, Jim Myers and I
      would steer the Saturday Morning Run down to the creek (via Ocean View)
      and run up to Cardiac and then back to the Mountain Home Inn parking lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This run had no real significance, except that it was part of
      our Dipsea training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would
      pretty much race from the creek to the top of Cardiac for bragging rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If you were in your thirties, as most of us were at the time, you
      needed to break 20 minutes on this run to be taken seriously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Jim Myers dubbed this run &quot;Dipsea Opening Day.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">One year, probably about '85 or '86,
      while we were waiting for the group to form up, I jokingly made-up a
      prayer to the Dipsea Gods as we stood at the creek (not out in the parking
      lot). The next year, I made another prayer, Steve Lyons added a prayer and
      the tradition was underway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      1990, someone put the Opening Day in the Gazette and Greg Nacco printed up
      T-shirts that he gave away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      printed up shirts, which were sold or given away (you know Greg) through
      1993.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The 1992 shirt (March 21 that year), for
      example, had a cartoon of Calvin and Hobbes careening down a hill in a
      little red wagon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hobbes
      says, &quot;Hey Man, this is Dynamite!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>To which Calvin replies, &quot;No, Hobbes, this is Suicide!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>On the back of the 1993 T-shirt, were song lyrics, like Bob
      Dylan's, &quot;Once upon a time, You ran so fine, Did the Dipsea, in your
      prime,&quot; and Hank Williams', &quot;I love you baby, But you gotta
      understand, When the Lord made me, He made me a Dipsea man,&quot; and
      Frank Sinatra's, &quot;When I was thirty-fifth, It was a very good
      year.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Regarding Pickett's hat, one year Don
      placed his hat on the ground and commanded us all to jump over it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Then he did the same thing another year and told us to run around
      it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In 1995 (I believe), Jerry Leith, then
      president of Tamalpa, called me at home to inform me that the Dipsea
      Opening Day would be on such-and-such a date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I was flabbergasted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
      couldn't believe that Jerry was taking control of the Opening Day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The result that year was two Opening Days, Jerry's and the one with
      me, Jim Myers, Greg Nacco, and Steve Lyons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The following year, I said, &quot;The hell with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Opening Day started off as a joke and now people are taking it
      seriously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's time to let
      it go.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">And since that date, Jim Myers and I
      have boycotted the Opening Day, but the pictures on this site of the 2006
      Opening Day (it looked small and informal) made me interested in coming
      back to this event in the future.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">You might be interested to know the Jim
      Myers created a tradition of &quot;zipping up the Dipsea for the
      winter.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in the
      fall, we would run down to Muir Woods and then run up the fire road from
      Franks Valley Road to the top of Cardiac, thereby &quot;zipping up the
      Dipsea.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>According to our tradition (never endorsed by Russ), we were
      supposed to stay off the Dipsea Trail until opening day (or the Dipsea
      Gods would be angered).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Russ,
      of course, always said that Dipsea Opening Day was the day following the
      second Sunday in June.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">A note from Roy about the 2006 Dipsea
      Opening Day:</p>
      <p align="left">Last year, (2005), it simply didn't happen. A few of us
      noticed and talked about doing an informal one, but never did. This year
      Jamie mentioned it again, and I agreed we should do it so we did a
      completely impromptu version. The one thing I remembered besides the
      speakers that Jerry always had lined up was that someone, (I thought it
      was Don Pickett), laid down a hat and everyone did a lap around it for
      luck.<!--mstheme--></font></td>
