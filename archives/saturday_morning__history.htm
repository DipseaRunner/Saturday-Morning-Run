      <P class=GazBody><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Originally 
      published in the Tamalpa Gazette in January, 1996.</I></P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>There’s a bit of Marin running history (and 
      thereby Tamalpa history) that is ripe to be told, and I guess it’s up to 
      me to tell it. It’s about the venerable Saturday Morning Run at Mountain 
      Home (we’ll call it the SMR to save space) — a tradition that stretches 
      back to those days of prehistory, before written records were kept and 
      before Tamalpa Runners was founded.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>The SMR is a group run that takes place every 
      Saturday morning at 9:00 a.m., year round. The meeting place is the 
      parking lot across the street from the Mountain Home Inn on Panoramic 
      Highway in Mill Valley. It’s not a Tamalpa event and never has been one. 
      Since it predates the club yet is still going strong, somehow it came to 
      have a life and style of its own. Part of its style is that there is no 
      organization, no real leader, and no plan. Runners simply gather and chat, 
      and somewhere around 9:05, someone says, “Let’s get going!” and the pack 
      moves out. Sometimes with a plan or destination in mind, sometimes not. If 
      there’s no plan the pack may stay together or splinter, who knows? Most of 
      the runners there know their way around the Mountain and know about how 
      far they want to go, and can pick out a route to suit. Those who don’t 
      know can ask. In fact, they <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">must</I> ask if they want to know 
      where everyone’s going or when they should turn back, because most often 
      there’s no leader to make announcements, coordinate the route, or look out 
      for stragglers (unless someone happens to appoint him or herself leader 
      for the day).</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>Obviously this style doesn’t work well for 
      everyone. For the timid, for the novice, for those who aren’t used to 
      hills, it’s not the best place to start. Those runners should try the 
      (official) Tamalpa Group Fun Runs instead, which do have leaders who make 
      sure no one gets lost.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>But for those hardier folks who are 
      comfortable “going with the flow”, the SMR is tops. Some reasons: It’s 
      always there, week after week, year after year — there’s remarkable 
      continuity. The number and variety of routes possible starting from 
      Mountain Home is huge. It’s a great way to learn the trails. It’s popular 
      — the turnout varies from a minimum of about 12 to as many as 50. It’s 
      anarchic — everyone is responsible for him or herself and can do what they 
      please without explanation.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>I’m a veteran of 15 years of SMR’s. That 
      qualifies me as one of the older oldtimers (though not the oldest by any 
      means). I’ve seen it through some ups and downs. Lately, the SMR has 
      seemed to be on a strong rebound. As I write this in mid-January, 1996, 
      the past Saturday saw over 40 runners. There was a nice mix of familiar 
      faces and as-yet unfamiliar ones.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>I’ve found the SMR to be a great place for 
      meeting people. This happens in a way that just suits me to a T (I’m a bit 
      reserved about meeting new people and I like to ease into it.) Actually, I 
      think I’ve made more friends this way than any other way. Here’s how it 
      works for me: As new people appear, the first month or two I don’t really 
      know them but their faces are beginning to look familiar. Eventually I 
      pick up on their first name (names take a while to sink in through my 
      thick skull).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In another 
      month I’ve chatted with them several times and maybe we mention our last 
      names. By this time we have seen each other enough that we have some idea 
      if we like each other. If we do, we’ll talk some more and maybe by the 
      time 4 to 6 months have gone by, we might get around to discussing what we 
      do for a living and all those other status-positioning things that in any 
      other context would come up on the very first meeting. But unlike the 
      cocktail party acquaintances, you have already got a bond of common 
      interest and common experience with the people you meet at the SMR. You 
      know whether you DO like them before you find out whether you’re SUPPOSED 
      to like them! And that’s the way it oughta be.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>The SMR originated way back in the late ’60’s. 
      Or was it 1970? No one remembers for sure. The founding fathers were Don 
      Pickett and Byron Lowry, a pair who had finished in first place and with 
      the fastest time, respectively, in the 1968 Dipsea. It was born of a 
      desire to better train for future Dipseas by running more on “The 
      Mountain,” then pretty much the exclusive domain of the Sierra Club and 
      other hiking groups. Within a year or two, the nascent SMR had grown to 
      include George Conlan, Hans Roenau, and Armand Castro as regulars. Of 
      those pioneers, Pickett and Roenau are still active in Tamalpa and still 
      make occasional SMR appearances. Other runners who became active as the 
      ‘70’s wore on were Arnold Knepfer, Karl Marshall, Bruce Carradine, Tom 
      Vaughan, Bob Biancalana, and the late Jim Farren, for whom a portion of 
      the Dipsea Trail is named. But co-founder Lowry was always the leader, 
      leading the group in exploring a new trail each week.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left><SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>If the SMR<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>pioneers had a club affiliation, 
      it was the Marin Athletic Club. Tamalpa Runners wasn’t started until 1976 
      (see the masthead on page 1 where it says “Volume XX”? This is your 20th 
      anniversary, pal!) In the early days the run was fast. It was an all-men’s 
      club, and it often turned into a head-banging race in the latter 
      miles.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, there always 
      were periodic stops to wait for the slowest runner. This sometimes became 
      a source of bemusement when a visiting celebrity runner would drop by. For 
      example, Pickett recalls Olympian marathoner and Sports Illustrated writer 
      Kenny Moore being surprised at a sudden stop on a ten mile loop. When 
      Pickett and Lowry explained why, Moore shrugged and said, “I’m just not 
      used to it.”<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Other running 
      royalty who joined in the SMR while on Bay Area visits included Jack 
      Foster, the Kiwi who then held the world masters marathon record, and 
      George Sheehan, the “running philosopher.”</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>The SMR group grew along with the “running 
      boom.” First Bruce Degen, Bob McLennan, and Russ Kiernan began 
      participating, with Degen often setting a blazing pace. Then Roger Gordon, 
      Ron Rahmer, Mike MacKenzie, George Frazier, and Keith Hastings started to 
      come every week. It was hard to get lost with the latter two in the group. 
      You would just pick up your ears and listen for the sound of raconteurs 
      Frazier and Hastings swapping stories and tall tales. The SMR was 
      developing a social side.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>In the late ’70’s women became part of the 
      SMR. Pickett recalled that the very first one was an early ultrarunner 
      named Natalie Cullimore, who, despite having completed a 100 mile race, 
      lasted only one week with the guys. Barbara Call (then known as Barbara 
      Magid), recruited by Hans Roenau from a 1977 San Francisco group run, 
      became the first regular. In the late 70’s Barbara was usually<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>the first woman in the Dipsea. By 
      the end of the decade, there were a dozen or so women running regularly: 
      First the “Five Redheads”: Barbara, Jenny Maxwell (née Biddulph, Barbara’s 
      teenage daughter), Susan Trott, Ann Neeley, and Claudia Shenefield. Then 
      came four of the Bay Area’s top women racers: Dana Hooper, Margaret 
      Livingston, Andrea Eschen, and Florianne Harp, who at the time were 
      entering every race around and burning up the roads.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>I came along in late 1980, after meeting Kees 
      Tuinzing, joining Tamalpa, and hearing the scuttlebutt about running on 
      The Mountain. It was the time when the Trailside Killer was on the loose 
      and new victims were being found monthly. Everyone was afraid. Fear forced 
      a special organization on the group. The runs were like convoys, with 
      everyone keeping together and male sweep runners checking for stragglers. 
      I learned my way around the trails under those conditions. I still get a 
      chill when I go by the spot on Matt Davis Trail where I once saw the 
      orange spray-painted outline of a body.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>Finally the killer was apprehended and locked 
      up. For a time, the SMR reverted to its old ways, with a lead pack of 
      hotshot guys hammering 10 to 15 miles every week. But now there were more 
      slower runners and women. Brian Lowry left to take a job back east, and 
      there was a new leader, Peter Eisenberg. Eisenberg was in charge by 
      default, because he liked to hear himself talk and make decisions for the 
      group, and no one else cared. Eisenberg, an oncologist, ushered in 
      the<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>era of the “running 
      docs”. I remember Bill Dickerson, Vince Oronzi, Marty Albion, Wally 
      Strauss, Knepfer, and Eisenberg, physicians all, trying to out-do each 
      other in telling dirty jokes as they ran.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>Eisenberg remained “leader” for several years, 
      then dropped out when he got into local politics. Hans Roenau filled the 
      void for awhile. Though his voice wasn’t as loud, Roenau could whistle <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">very</I> loudly. Various others have 
      taken a turn, eventually it became clear the group can do just as well 
      without a leader. On a recent Saturday I witnessed Ron Rahmer trying to 
      lead, with mixed success. Half the people who followed him got lost, as 
      usual. The other half had enough sense not to follow him.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>A vital issue in SMR history was the question 
      of who “owned” it. Was it the “property” of the founders, of the current 
      crop of Saturday Morning runners, or of Marin’s only real running club, 
      Tamalpa, to which the vast majority of the participants belonged? And 
      depending on the answer was the corollary issue of who could know about it 
      and be part of it. Was it a private party or a public service? I was 
      President of Tamalpa from 1981 to 1986, and each year I would reiterate my 
      feeling that regardless of how the SMR got to be what it was, the club 
      should step in and adopt it by publicizing it in the <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gazette</I>. I felt it was too good a 
      thing to be kept “secret” and known only through word of mouth. The 
      secrecy made it very hard for newcomers and less active members to know 
      where the <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">real</I> running action 
      in Marin was.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But each year, 
      I would bring it up for a vote and each year the Board voted to keep it 
      out of the Gazette. Talk about legislative gridlock. I’d hear arguments 
      like: there are enough people already, there isn’t enough parking, and “if 
      it ain’t broke don’t fix it.” In fact, the SMR didn’t make it into the <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gazette</I> until Jerry Leith became 
      President much later. By that time, there was a different (less elitist) 
      crew on the Tamalpa Board, and no one seemed to care so passionately any 
      more. But even now, the little calendar item on the SMR contains 
      disclaimers emphasizing its anarchic nature and unofficial status.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>The SMR is not only a place to meet other 
      runners, but a place to return to when you have been absent for a while. 
      When a former SMR runner who has moved away from Marin happens to be in 
      town for a visit, Mountain Home at 9:00 is the logical place to go to find 
      old friends. F’rinstance, Bob Groff, a long-time Tamalpan who now lives in 
      Iowa, showed up just a couple of weeks ago. Bert Botta, now of St. Louis, 
      comes every couple of years. This past summer, 1979 Dipsea winner Don 
      Chaffee, currently a Michigan resident, showed up on a Bay Area visit, and 
      I had a wonderful run with him and Russ Kiernan, as the two old-timers 
      recounted the ’79 Dipsea. It was one of the closest Dipseas ever, with 
      Chaffee finishing first and Kiernan second, the two running head-to-head 
      the whole way from the same starting group. The question came up as to 
      whether Kiernan ever held the lead, and if so, where. Those two guys <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">still</I> don’t agree on what 
      happened, after all these years! They should read Barry Spitz’s book.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>One of my favorite SMR reunions came a few 
      years ago. Bud Krogh, the convicted head of the notorious Plumbers of the 
      Nixon re-election campaign,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>and, after rehabilitation, active Tamalpan in the late ’70’s, 
      showed up on a visit from his current home in Seattle. Bud regaled the SMR 
      crowd with untold tales of the White House, including the story of the day 
      when Elvis Presley showed up, without an appointment, and demanded to see 
      the President. (Nixon did see him, but first had to be briefed on who the 
      so-called “King” was.)</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>For me, the SMR would never be complete 
      without breakfast afterward. And throughout its history, THE place for the 
      classic runners’ breakfast was the Mill Valley Coffee Shop. This 
      unassuming cafe on the corner of Locust and Miller was the perfect spot 
      because: It was convenient, located just at the bottom of the hill; it was 
      less crowded, being outside downtown and less given to yuppified touches 
      like parsley garnishes; and there were cute waitresses who were willing to 
      put up with a wide range of noisy shenanigans and endless table 
      rearrangements to accommodate crowds of sweaty runners that sometimes 
      reached 20.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>For a long time there was even a blown-up 
      photo of about a dozen runners crammed around a table for four gracing the 
      walls of the “Shop”. It’s not there any more, but I well remember the 
      grinning countenances of Florianne Harp, Therese Jennings, Vince Oronzi, 
      John Fischer, Barbara Magid and Peter Laskier, and of course, Mr. 
      Personality, Peter Eisenberg at the center, beaming down from that 
      wall.</P>
      <P class=GazBody align=left>And you know what? All this fun is still going 
      on, every Saturday morning, 9 o’clock, at Mountain Home.</P>
