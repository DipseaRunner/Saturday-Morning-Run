        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Since its
        inception three years ago, the DBICC(ITB)R race has become my favorite
        race. It reminds me of my early Dipsea training runs where we would try
        to fine “alternate routes”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
        we would actually find shorter paths to Stinson, but usually we would
        just run ourselves into the ground and get poison oak and bee stings.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Last Sundays
        race was going precisely according to plan, until Scott said “GO”.
        Starting on the bike path, I told Roy I was going to follow him, then
        outrun him at the finish line like that guy tried last year. It didn’t
        work for me either because a few yards later, Roy and Rob Flatland took
        off in separate directions, leaving me in the dust. Shortly, David, Jed,
        and Nick all caught up and took a route I had not expected. I followed a
        short distance, and then backtracked to plan B, which took me up
        Madrone, Redwood or Baltimore Canyon, all the same place, but with
        various historic names still commonly used to describe this beautiful
        area.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Taking the
        smaller trail past Barbara Spring, and climbing up to Blithedale Ridge,
        I was followed closely by Chris Greene, and further down the hill,
        Tomas. Chris and I ran together for a while, and heard Tomas grunting
        and trudging through some very dense foliage below the road. Chris is a
        very talented cyclist and runner. He placed fourth in this years hill
        climb, and holds the record for the cycling hill climb up railroad
        grade, and did this on a single speed bike! He soon pulled away from me
        before Indian Fire Trail.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">My biggest goal
        was to get to Lake Lagunitas with as big a lead as possible, because
        I’m not that fast on flat roads, and the runners that I might be ahead
        of at the top would certainly reel me in on the flat sections below. Rob
        is one of these people, as well as Dave, Greg, Jed, Mike and most of the
        rest of the field. Climbing up I passed Janet on the Indian Fire Trail,
        she told me my place, fifth at that point. I figured Roy and Chris were
        ahead, and probably Jamie and Judy. Rob passed me shortly after, then
        Tomas caught up and we ran together to the top. That means Jed, David,
        Greg, Mike, Nick, Dave and several others are still possibly behind me.
        I didn’t know where anyone else was, so I panicked. I tore down the
        East Peak Fire Trail, which isn’t very runnable, whacked my head on a
        low branch, and ran past Boy George while he mumbled a delicate, little
        song.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">When I was a kid
        we used to hike to the top of Tam, then run down this trail and dive
        into a certain type of brush that would, if you did it right, spring you
        back onto your feet like an inclined trampoline! One time a friend dove
        into a crag of Manzanita, which is like diving into a pile of very sharp
        knives, and cut a huge gash in his leg. We patiently demonstrated the
        proper diving technique, and the right type of plant, ran the rest of
        the way and then brought him to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Anyway, at the
        top, Tomas took off in a different direction, apparently to swim across
        the lake and cut off too large coves. I too was going to swim, until I
        suddenly realized I forgot my Speedo, so swimming was out of the
        question; I’d have to run the entire way.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">I made it
        Lagunitas, ran hard on the flat roads, caught up with Chris past the Sky
        Oaks ranger station, crossed the BoFax road and ran on to the Concrete
        Pipe road, where suddenly Rob was 40 yards behind, and closing fast. I
        told Chris I knew of a little known trail called the “Raging
        Squirrel” trail, but I wasn’t exactly sure where it was. I told
        Chris he was welcome to join me, but there was a risk of getting lost or
        hurt. As Rob flew by, I decided to take a chance, and off the road Chris
        and I went, plunging down through the forest slipping and sliding at a
        high rate of speed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        turned out that this faint little trail put us ahead of Rob, and Chris
        and I finished 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> overall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Roy, Jamie and Judy were cheering for us at the finish line. But
        where was Tomas? I heard he spent several tense minutes in the Sky Oaks
        jail, until Dipsea Boy bailed him out. We shouldn’t talk about it
        here.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Many many thanks
        to the Schneiders for putting up with us and sharing their fine food and
        comfortable home. And a very sincere thanks to the Dipsea Boy. Without
        you, Roger would probably be putting this race on.</font></p>
