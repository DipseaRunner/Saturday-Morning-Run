      standing on the porch of cabin 21 in Curry Village in the pre-dawn
      darkness. Our itinerary lists this as “Sunday 6 am: The intrepid few
      meet on someone's porch for the hike to the amazing Secret Spot.” And,
      here we are. The intrepid few turned out to be fifteen including Eric and
      his two boys, Elliot and Jackson. These guys got up at 4 am in Mariposa to
      be here by 6. That’s the way the whole trip has gone, overwhelming
      enthusiasm has been our approach to everything.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">“The promise is
      you won’t tell anybody, ever, where it is. You can show it to anyone you

      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Back in the
      1920’s people were searching for a place with a view of four major
      Yosemite waterfalls. People tried the most obvious viewpoints without
      luck. Then using cartography tools someone predicted where it might be,
      and they proved to be correct. The four falls are Yosemite Falls, Nevada
      Falls, Vernal Falls, and Illilouette Falls. The Sierra Club built a
      railing around the spot and steps on the steepest parts of the approach.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">“The first thing
      is, you have to personally take them there – no giving directions –
      and the second thing is, you have to get them to make this same promise.
      Agreed?”</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">And, with that,
      fifteen of us are off in the dark to see one of the most special places I
      know.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">I had originally
      floated the idea for a Yosemite trip on the Saturday Morning Run website
      back in early spring, but I wasn’t sure I could generate enough momentum
      to get the core Saturday group on board. Then Jamie had the idea of
      combining Yosemite with Jack Kirk’s 100<sup>th</sup> birthday planned to
      be held in Mariposa – only an hour’s drive from the Valley. So I
      mustered the most enticing email I could and within two days ten or twelve
      of us were in for sure and a few others maybe. By the end of two weeks we
      were up to twenty and this thing was starting to look like a whole lot of
      fun.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Reservations in
      Yosemite are difficult, at best. If you’re planning a year in advance
      you’re in pretty good shape, but who does that? Carmen and I like the
      Curry Village Cabins with bath. Unlike tents and tent cabins, you can
      bring your stuff inside without worrying about bears and it’s only a
      ten-foot walk from your bed to the bathroom rather than having to fumble
      with clothes and shoes and squirm through a hundred-yard trudge to the
      community bathrooms to read the “closed for cleaning” sign. So I
      checked the dates we wanted and, of course, there was nothing available.
      Carmen and I had been through this many times before and I had finally
      taken the time to write a computer program that checks for cancellations
      every few minutes and text messages my phone if there are any. I set this
      to work and got one or two cabins in the first two weeks – I needed
      eleven.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Besides the trip
      to the Secret Spot, we did two runs in Yosemite. The Friday we arrived we
      started from Glacier Point, three thousand feet up the cliff almost
      directly above Curry Village. This is where they used to build a huge
      bon-fire every morning and then push the embers off the cliff after dark
      making a falls of fire to compete with nature’s watery versions. The
      Park Service decided this wasn’t really in the spirit of things and
      ended the tradition in 1968.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Glacier Point
      looks out over the Valley from its middle. In almost every direction the
      views are overwhelming and this is a perfect place to begin our
      adventures. From here we ran down to Illilouette Falls. There’s a great
      pool and water slide at the top and Doug and I dove in while everyone else
      watched. Doug provided much entertainment by smacking a ledge on his way
      down the slide. The water was wonderful and we were dry within minutes of
      getting out.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Panorama Trail
      leads from Illilouette over to Nevada Falls. Here the Merced River leaves
      Little Yosemite Valley and begins its tumble down to Yosemite Valley
      proper. It starts with the 700-foot Nevada Falls drop. We spent lots of
      time here both days goofing around, leaning on the railings looking down
      the cliffs, and getting lost in the falling water.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">From here, it’s
      down the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls. In spring and summer sections of the
      Mist Trail are shrouded in mist from the falls. Being here in late
      September meant it was dry for us, but the falls and river provided all
      the grandeur we needed. The Mist Trail ends in the Valley and it’s a
      half-mile level run through dogwoods, pines, and cedars to Curry Village,
      our new home.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Four weeks
      earlier, as I’m pulling in the driveway at our house, my phone beeps
      with a message, “cabins with bath, 29<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup>.”
      I run inside, bring up the Yosemite Reservations site and punch in the
      dates. They’re still available! As quick as I can, I fill in the form
      and submit it. Reservation confirmed. Yes! The site doesn’t tell me how
      many are available so, just in case, I go back to see if there might be
      another… and there is! I grab it and check again, and there’s another,
      and then another, and another… Now I’m like a drug addict, more, more,
      more. Finally, I force myself to stop and take stock. I’ve just booked
      nine cabins and I already had two. That covers us all so I decide to get
      one more just in case someone else signs on. Within a day Eric wants in so
      the extra cabin is gone. Then Scott and Pam join up, and Stan and Mel and
      the kids, and Chesley, and then Jeff, and I’m back to searching again.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Eventually we have
      thirty-one people. I got the last two cabins we needed with a week to
      spare for a total of sixteen – all in a row – our own little section
      of the Village. Every evening, after the run, we’d disappear into our
      cabins for a shower and a change and then wander out to the porch of cabin
      21 for the evening wine and cheese social. This was great fun. Seems like
      everyone brought two or three bottles of wine, three or four kinds of
      cheese, crackers, grapes, olives, bread, and more. We sat around for hours
      reliving the day, laughing, talking, eating, drinking and having a great
      time. Then sunset would happen and we’d walk two porches down to watch
      Half Dome steal the show in the dimming glow. Then a bunch of us would
      head off to the Ahwahnee bar for dinner and drinks.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">The first thing on
      our itinerary for Saturday was “Saturday 7am: Meet on someone's&nbsp;porch
      to walk over to the Ahwahnee for breakfast.” Our path from Curry strolls
      through the Ahwahnee meadow just as the cliffs begin to catch the morning
      light. The Ahwahnee is a grand old hotel completed in 1927. Breakfast in
      the dining room with its massive cedar log construction and huge,
      floor-to-rafter windows is one of life’s great pleasures.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">After breakfast we
      all meet back at cabin 21 for the run up to Half Dome. This is about
      fifteen miles round trip with 4,800 feet of climbing so we’re planning
      to spend most of the day at it. We climb back up the Mist Trail to the top
      of Nevada Falls where we were the day before, then through a part of
      Little Yosemite Valley and up through forest, sometimes stopping to smell
      the Ponderosa pines – the bark has a pleasing vanilla-like scent. Jim
      takes a misstep and lands hard on his forearm. This quickly swells to near
      the size of golf ball, but he perseveres. Eventually we come out onto
      steep, open granite slabs and steps. There are many, many people going
      both up and down here. People of all shapes and sizes, all either
      determined to make the top, or really happy for having done so.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">The last part of
      the climb is class-5 rock climbing, meaning ropes and hardware are
      required. Fortunately, the Park Service has provided that for us in the
      form of steel stanchions bolted to the rock with two parallel cables
      running along them all the way to the top of the dome. And the scene here
      is amazing – as though on a crowded Sunday in Muir Woods all the people
      decided to go rock climbing in the same place at the same time. As you
      approach the base of this, you see a pile of hundreds of gloves. You
      rummage through the pile and choose a couple, maybe a pair, maybe not.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">There are
      inevitably one or two couples at the bottom discussing the ascent. One is
      saying to the other, (could be the man or the woman, seems to be about
      fifty, fifty), “You’ll be fine. Just look at your feet, don’t look
      down. I’ll stay right behind. It’ll be okay…”</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">And you grab a
      cable in each hand and begin pulling yourself up. You really have to see
      pictures of this. When we were here, there were perhaps two hundred people
      at a time on these cables. People are trying to go up and down. If you try
      to stay between the cables you barely move for the traffic jam. We all
      eventually went to the outside, working our way up hand over hand on a
      single cable. But even here there are people going both directions so
      you’re constantly letting someone cross under or around, or crossing
      over to the outside of the other cable. And this is all taking place on
      class-5 rock! This went on for hours while we were there and it must
      happen every day, or at least every weekend day, with no supervision or
      organization of any kind. And yet, I’ve never heard of anyone falling.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">The top of Half
      Dome is as spectacular as it looks from below. If you have the nerve to
      sit on the edge, an eighteen hundred foot cliff drops straight away and
      then slopes steeply for another three thousand feet to Yosemite Valley. We
      took the same group pictures a million people have taken before us on the
      brow of the dome with the meadows and El Capitan as backdrop. And
      they’re just as amazing as they are for all those other people. At one
      point, a guy next to us pulled out a ring and proposed to his girlfriend.
      She didn’t hesitate to say yes and our whole corner of the dome broke
      out in applause.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Eventually, we
      took our turn as the down traffic on the cables and then ran back to
      Nevada Falls and down through the fiery fall colors along the Muir Trail
      to Curry Village and our evening wine and cheese.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">Melanie and Stan
      and their two kids, Kate and Tommy heard about this trip at the last
      minute and signed on. They didn’t run with us, but they were great fun
      at the wine &amp; cheese socials. On Saturday, as we were leaving to walk
      the half-mile stroll through the meadow for dinner at the Ahwahnee, Tommy
      grabbed my hand and decided he would be my guardian for the evening.
      Although Melanie thanked me for putting up with him, in truth, I loved
      every moment of it. There’s nothing like being adopted by a kid to make
      you feel good.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">It’s still dark
      as we leave the main trail and head off into the woods to pick up the
      Secret Spot Trail. Eventually, we come to old stone steps and other
      indications of the old trail. We stop to regroup. The morning light is
      beginning to glow on the cliffs and The Apron, a broad sweep of granite
      sloping steeply up from Curry Village dominates the Valley.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#808080" face="Times New Roman">We round a corner
      onto a rib of granite running down from the peak above us. The ground
      ahead drops away and we walk out onto an eagle’s nest ledge with open
      air below our feet on three sides. There is a rusted railing running
      around the ledge and the views are breath taking in all directions.
      Everyone is impressed. Roger keeps grinning and saying this is the best
      thing he’s seen on the whole trip. Eric can’t stop beaming and the
      kids are really excited. Everyone is staring out into the views. You just
      can’t get enough of this place. It’s as though human senses can’t
      quite absorb all that they know is here.</font></p>

      morning, after breakfast, we drove to Mariposa for Jack Kirk’s 100<sup>th</sup>
