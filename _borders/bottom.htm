<p>Friday afternoon a dusting of snow&nbsp; turned Tamalpais white at the West
Point Inn level and above. Footsteps in the East Peak parking lot and around the
peak on Verna Dunshee Trail left inch-and-a-half deep impressions. By Saturday
morning it was down to patches but we did have a couple snow flurries.</p>

<p>The Throne is in an open, sunny view spot in a hobbit landscape. There
is a shrine here and people come to be with their thoughts among nature's best.
Many scraggly Sargent Cypress trees grow around boulders in fantastic shapes
like a bonsai forest made life-size. The throne itself is a large armchair made from piled rocks. In the past it was a single
chair but has
recently evolved into a two-and-a-half seater. It faces the the setting sun.</p>

<p>Most of this adventure involved trails not shown on the map. We did some
normal stuff like Cataract Trail, Benstein Trail, Swede George Trail, parts of
Kent and Stocking trails, but also things with names like Dipsea Boy Shortcut,
Fairly Carvin', and Scary-Dude-With-The-Knife Trail. The Anchor Tree itself is
an old Douglas Fir growing from the bank of a remote little stream. At some
point it must have been&nbsp; knocked over and sprouted what is now the main trunk from its
middle; the
original trunk forms the flukes of the anchor. Knowing how to find the Anchor
Tree is somewhat of a local knowledge test - a bit like knowing how to find Music Camp was forty years ago.</p>

<p>On an obscure trail in a spot overlooking the ocean there is a plaque dated
Christmas Eve, 1969. It proclaims it's author's sincere love for his girlfriend.
This was one of our destinations on this run. There are other plaques around.
There's the aviator's plaque near East Peak, and another one from 1992 dedicating Ted
Cooper bridge, and one proclaiming a small footbridge to be an Eagle
Scout project. Supposedly the Hogan Tree, near Hidden Lake, had a plaque at one
time. Now, no one seems to know which tree is or was the Hogan Tree. Speculation
is that it fell years ago, plaque side down. There was also a plaque on a
stone pedestal at the end of a short trail near Van Wyck Meadow commemorating
those who died in World War I. Several years ago someone apparently thought it
would look better on their wall, (or possibly on their ebay auction), and it
went missing; only the pedestal
remains.</p>
